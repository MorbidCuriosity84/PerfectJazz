This is Perfect Jazz. Our attempt at recreating some of the top scrolling shooters from the arcade era of the 80s/90s. 

To install, just download the zip PerfectJazz and run the installer. To build from source you will need CMake and Visual Studio or a compiler/IDE of your choice. Clone the repo. Point CMake at the directory you cloned and then choose a build directory. Initialise the submodules using git submodule init, then update using git submodule update. Build the solution in CMake and then launch VS. In VS choose the release build and configure the entry point to be WinMain. Build the solution and enjoy.
